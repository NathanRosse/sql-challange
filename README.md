# sql-challange

I wasn't able to schedule a tutor this week for the homework so here goes nothing. Ran into the same guy from ASKbcs and he helped uout a great deal. I still have to do more such as clean up my code and comprehend it deeper as I was looking at 3 different people tackle this code and my main issue is just comprehending the need for variables in certain spots vs. just thinking its a syntax error. I need to learn more about what I can and can't do.
